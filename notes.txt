for some reason, it is best to correlate with circle mask with half the radius of the circles in the picture...

what params can be tuned...
    1. circle_mask_rad - of course the truth - 30
    2. pxcorr1 & pxcorr2 - looks like 90 the best its the knee
    3. find peaks - size of the max min filter - looks like more or less the best is to put it to the radius of the circle
    4. find peaks - threshold - doesnt have a very big impact, leave it at 0.1, when lower, doesnt
        change anything, if higher, it slightly increases precision but largely decreases recall

now need to do some preprocessing + final script to showcase
    - here fix the errors on the img batch and create output visualization tools...
    - write some readme
